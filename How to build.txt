How to build

Open the file webTest/src/webTest.java in Eclipse within a project which has the JUnit
and Selenium jar files on the build path. The webTest.java file contains the JUnit
tests using the Selenium web plugin, and can be run as a regular JUnit test suite
which will start Firefox instances to run the tests.
